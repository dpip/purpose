    We founded Purpose UX in November 2015 with the belief that people deserve digital products that are tailored to their needs.
    <br>
    <br>
    We saw too many companies spend months and months polishing designs, only to have their product disappear without a ripple. Too many times we heard "We'll fix it later," only to find that the dev budget was exhausted and what was built didn't work.

  <div class = "vision-row" id = "v-row-two">
    We connect with users before committing to code.
    <br>
    <br>
    We find the right solution instead of wasting effort on the wrong one.
    <br>
    <br>
    We are practitioners, not gurus.

        Erik spent a good chunk of his professional career convincing teenagers that studying algebra was a worthwhile use of their time, before accepting defeat and becoming a user experience designer instead. As it turns out, the same skills at eliciting feedback, understanding how students think, and helping people grasp logical yet complex mathematics were perfect preparation for designing interfaces for modern software. As product designer for Purpose UX, Erik leads workshops, defines requirements, creates fast prototypes, and conducts usability studies, among other things.

        James is a UX traveler: his adventures have taken him inside prisons on research visits, beside teenagers hunting for the best ringtones, across the table from small business owners testing email marketing solutions, and into the classroom with middle schoolers to envision the future of digital learning. James has 10 years of experience in everything UX including interaction design, information architecture, user research, and running a team. James is in heaven whenever he's designing interfaces, interviewing users, or leading whiteboard discussions.
